# Data-aggregation-and-implication (DAI in short)

This repository contains the main materials for a short course on 
data aggregation and summarization and implications for business (**DA-I for Business** in short).

The main structure of the course is as follows:

* Data aggregation and summarization of **a single** object/entity/variable
* Data aggregation and summarization of **multiple** objects/entities/variables
* Data aggregation and summarization of **relationships** (between one or multiple y's and multiple x's).
* Implications of data aggregation and summarization for business.

The short course has been offered in two consecutive classes to students in two sessions in the marketing analytics course by Prof. [Inyoung Chae](https://professor.skku.edu/researcher_eng/professorList.do?mode=view&perId=LZStrAoJQ7AZgJgXgmgJgQCQGoBYDKANA6gawHFgBZAZwDsBFAXhqA%20&categoryId=U&jojikCode1=3169) at [SKKU Business School](https://biz.skku.edu/eng_bizskk/index.do) on 26 Nov and 3 Dec, 2024.

The short course will be incorporated as separate modules in the courses at PolyU at various levels (DBA, PhD, masters, and undergraduates).
